                <p>
                    If you book any item, we do not guarantee that the product/item is available at that moment which may lead to delay in delivery or cancellation of order.

                <b>Delivery</b>
                <p>
                    Deliveries will be sent to your invoice address, unless we are informed of a different delivery address at the time of ordering. Please bear in mind that all deliveries will be sent by a third party courier service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please also inform us of any periods where you may not be around to receive deliveries, i.e. a holiday, so that we can ensure we do not dispatch during this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are unable to give you an exact time of delivery via the courier; however, you will be able to track your parcel online. If the courier attempts to deliver your parcel and leaves a ‘While you were out’ card but you do not contact them to arrange re-delivery, the parcel will be returned to Rushabh Novelty and you will be required to pay another delivery charge for the parcel to be re-sent.
                    Rushabh Novelty cannot guarantee delivery on any particular date. If you require stationery to arrive on a particular date, we will do our best to arrange the delivery accordingly but cannot guarantee this.
                </p>

                        IMPORTANT: Rushabh Novelty cannot be held responsible for delays in delivery due to circumstances out of our control, such as postal strikes or adverse weather conditions. Rushabh Novelty shall not be liable for any losses, damages or expenses incurred by the customer arising out of any delays in delivery or damage or loss during transit.
